Description: Provides adaptive direct sparse regression for high-dimensional multimodal data with heterogeneous missing patterns and measurement errors. AdapDISCOM extends the DISCOM framework with modality-specific adaptive weighting to handle varying data structures and error magnitudes across blocks. The method supports flexible block configurations (any K blocks) and includes robust variants for heavy-tailed distributions (AdapDISCOM-Huber) and fast implementations for large-scale applications (Fast-AdapDISCOM). Designed for realistic multimodal scenarios where different data sources exhibit distinct missing data patterns and contamination levels.
